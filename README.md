Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is said to be the systematic application of engineering methods, principles and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
it is important to the technology industry because it plays a very unique and crucial role such by enabling the creation of software applications and system that power various aspects of modern life. These includes communication, media and entertainment, healthcare etc


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

First is the development of programming languages such Fortran, kobo, C to mention a few thes allow programmrs to create more softwares
secondly the establishment of software engineering as a discipline, this actually change the game in the 1960s because if there is a program there will be an update the software engineering came in to bridges the gap.
thirly and more recently the rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing
Development
Maintenance
The phases of the SDLC involve the requirements which include the gathering and documenting the user needs and system requirements, while the design creates high-level and detailed design architecture, then the implementation that is by writing code and building the software according to the design specification. Testing include conducting different test to be sure the software meet quality standards and requirements then Deployment which is the time to release the software for users  then maintenance which includes updating, providing support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is said to be sequential approach with distinct phases like design, implementation flowing downward like waterfall while Agile is Iterative and incremental in approach which focused on flexibility, collaboration and responce to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing codes and implementating software solutions while a Quality assurance manager ensure the software quality by designing and executing test plans. Then the project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is important in the sense that, it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. while the VCS track changes to source code and coodinate work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines this is pressure to deliver the software products the solution to this is for the engineer to give the client enough timing if the delivery time is within 5months 2 extra months should be added not to give the client less time better to deliver before due date than after
Secondly changing requirements

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Intergration testing this involves tedting interactions between different components or subsystem
Acceptance testing involve testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets their needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is crafting questions or statemens to get the best possible responses from AI models. Its important because it helps to avoid confusion, it makes the question clear and specific.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Nigerian the AI will give geneal answer but if you ask" Tell me about Nigerian culture and their way of life" it has been narrowed down.
